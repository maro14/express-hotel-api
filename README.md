## Hotel Booking System Backend
This is the backend code for a hotel booking system. It is built using Node.js and Express.js, and uses MongoDB as the database.

### Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: 
``` git clone https://github.com/maro14/hotel-backend.git ```
* Install dependencies: 
``` npm install ```
* Copy the example environment variables file: ``` cp .env.example .env ```
* Set the environment variables in the ``` .env ``` file to match your system configuration.
* Start the server: ``` yarn start ```
* The server should now be running on ``` http://localhost:5000. ```
